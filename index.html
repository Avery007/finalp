<div id="poem1"> <p>You've got to be ready<br>
You don't want to be scared<br>
Just know you're really there<br>
You've got to have someone to show what you're really there<br>
You've got to be just like someone<br>
Who really knows just another day<br>
You've got to have someone to show what you're like<br>
There's no need to hurry<br>
For just a little bit of solitude<br>
Just one moment every morning<br>
Watching the stars fall from the skies<br>
You'll understand what it means to me<br>
To be in the complete silence of the wild west<br>
You've got to have someone to show what you're really there<br>
You've got to be just like someone<br>
Who really knows just another day<br>
You've got to have someone to show what you're really there<br>
You've got to be just like someone<br>

<div id="poem2"> <p>Any Troubles In The Future<br>
I don't know when he stopped <br>
I don't know what he said <br>
But I know he made me  <br>
A gonna see my world falling <br>
A gonna see my world falling  <br>
A gonna see my world falling   <br>
'Cause you're the only one I love <br>
Any troubles in the future  <br>
They can wait till the sun goes down <br>
Or the world keeps quiet on the world <br>
I know you keep the love inside of you and <br>
This one's for the taking  <br>
You're the only one I love  <br>
Any troubles in the future  <br>
They can wait till the sun goes down <br>
Or the world keeps quiet on the world  <br>
I know you keep the love inside of you and  <br>
This one's for the taking  <br>
You're the only one I love  <br>
Any troubles in the future <br> </p></div>

<div id="lyrics"> <b>Who Can Stop The Pain</b><br>Verse 1<br>Cause I got the reason <br>Cause I'm looking out expecting a Hurricane hurricane <br>
Cause I don't know if I can keep storm clouds away<br>I don't wanna let my spirit run wild <br>Storm clouds get in the way <br>Chorus<br>I've got a lot to learn<br>
When it comes to love being cold will do <br>I wanna be the one <br>Cause you get the ocean <br>Verse 2 <br>And the cold and wet <br>And I wanna be the only thing <br>Who can stop the pain <br>When it comes to you and me <br>
You can let the emotions run wild <br>I wanna be the one <br>Chorus <br>I've got a lot to learn <br>When it comes to love being cold will do <br>I wanna be the one <br>Cause you get the ocean<br> </div>

<div id="poem3"> <b>I Wanna Know </b><br><br>
The sun shines upon you like a jewel<br>
As the morning sun goes down<br>
And your world shines like a diamond<br>
That's the way it began..<br>
It's the way that it began..<br>
Time is breath<br>
It's the sun in my eyes<br>
I wanna know<br>
What did I do today<br>
I wanna know<br>
Oh no, it's really hard<br>
I wanna know<br>
No no, it's really hard<br>
I wanna know<br>
Oh it's a hard day's night<br>
Oh so hard<br>
Oh it's a hard day's night<br>
Oh so hard<br></div>
